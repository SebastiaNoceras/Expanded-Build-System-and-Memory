# Description: Familiarizes with GNU's gcc, Make, size, objcpy and objdump utilities. 

In this programming assignment, you will get more experience with Git Version control, write more C-programming code, and integrate your code with your build system. You will reuse your version control repository and add some new c-programming functions that manipulate memory. You will test your code on your host machine, but your code should compile for both the target platform and host platform. We will use the target platform in future assignments.

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

Incorporate a c-program application into your Make and GCC build system
Write c-program functions that manipulate memory
Execute and test your application by simulating it on the host machine
